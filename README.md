# FoodDropOff
Our website is called Food Drop Off. Food Drop Off is a platform for restaurants to organize group food deliveries. In the current COVID-19 economic environment, restaurants are struggling to stay afloat due to a huge decline in customers. Many restaurants have started to organize group food deliveries through Facebook in order to reach many customers all at once and avoid the cost of delivery apps. The general process is a restaurant will post in a Facebook group that they will be taking orders for a food delivery on a specific day at a public location like a grocery store parking lot. Customers will direct message the poster to place their order with the restaurant then meet at the specified time and location to pick up the order. The current system puts a large administrative load on restaurants to manage customer orders and requests because of the unorganized nature of direct messages. Our website will allow customers to easily place their orders and restaurants to easily manage those orders. The three main features of our website will be a menu upload system for restaurants to manage their offerings, an event creation system for restaurants to create and manage drop off events, and a checkout system for users to place their orders for different drop off events.
